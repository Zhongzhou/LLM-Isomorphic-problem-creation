    title: Comparison of flight time in prabolic trajectory
    bank_id: PHY1-2D-TRAJCOMP-041125 # Trajectory Comparison
    description: Asks students to compare the flight time of three projectile motion trajectories. 
      The three trajectories have varied heights and varied ranges, and the height relation is different from the range relation.
      The range relation is used as one distractor and there are two other random distractors.

    generation prompts:
    # The following are the prompts that generate the questions in the problem bank.
    # Isomorphic problems can be generated by more than 1 prompt.
    # These can also be urls that points to other md files in the same folder, such as standard formatting prompts.
    # Also urls that points to data tables and python scripts associated with the creation 
        - prompt 1: | # Generate all flight time relations 
            I would like to create different versions of a physics problem involving the trajectory of projectile motion of three objects, labeled A, B and C, that started from the same position from the ground and landed back on the ground. The question is about comparing the flight time of the three trajectories. First, please list all possible relations between the flight time of the three trajectories, for example, A > B > C, or A = B < C.
        - prompt 2: | # Generate 2 range relations that are different. This step required o3-mini to correctly complete
            Next, for each of the 13 flight time relation, I want to generate 2 possible relationships between the ranges of the three trajectories. The requirement is that: 
            1. The trajectories must be written in the same order as the flight time relation 
            2. For each relation in the flight time, replace with a different relation for Range. For example, replace ">" with either "<" or "=". 
            3. If a relation is in the non-determinant form such as "A < B > C", or "B > A < C" replace it with a different one according to the above two rules. 
            4. Avoid all equal relations such as "A = B = C" for the range.
            Output the relations in a "long" table form with one column for flight time and one column for range 
        
        - prompt 3: | # Create random parameters for height and range. This step I also used o3-mini
            Next step, for each row of the above table, come up with randomized parameters for the height of each trajectory, and the range of each trajectory. The requirements are: 1. the height parameter must be between 0.1 and 1, and the range parameter must be between 0.2 and 1.5 2. The relation between the height parameters should be the same as the flight time relations, and the relation between the range parameters should be the same as the range relations. 3. The variation between every two parameters should be greater than 0.2 and less than 0.8, unless they need to be equal to each other. Round all numbers to two decimal places after zero
        - prompt 4: | # Create the diagrams 
            Now write a program using python and matplotlib to generate one diagram for each row in the above table, according to the parameters in the Table. In each diagram, the three trajectories will be represented by parabolic lines using dashed lines. All three trajectories should start from the same point on the x-axis and end on the x-axis (but not necessarily at the same location). Label the three trajectories with large and bold font, and use a thick line along the x-axis to represent "ground". Do not show axis or gridlines in the final diagram. 
            Name the diagrams q-1 through q-26, and create a downloadable zip file for all the diagrams
        - prompt 5: |
            Next, first add a column to the table named "Question", and label each row from q-1 to q-26, and retain only the flight time and range columns. Second, add two columns named "Distractor I" and "Distractor II".  Each column should contain one random relation between A, B and C that is different from either the flight time or the range. Avoid non-determinant forms such as "A < B > C", or "B > A < C" 
        - prompt 6: |
            Next, come up with 10 possible situations that involve projectile motion of three objects, all three projectiles should start from ground level and land on ground level. For example, three boys throwing rocks, three gunships firing guns, etc. Avoid objects that might be subjected to air resistance, such as arrows.
        - prompt 7: |
            All of them are good, randomly add the names of the 10 scenarios to the table above in a new column named "scenarios"
        - prompt 8: |
            Write the question body for each of the 10 scenarios above, stating that the trajectories are shown in the figure, and ask the students which of the following is the correct ranking of the time it takes for the objects to hit the ground. Do not write the choice items for now. Don't say "from longest to shortest".
        - prompt 9: |
            Now for each row in the table above, create the multiple choice problem with the choice items, according to the problem body above, and the four relations. The flight time relation is the correct answer. Write the multiple-choice problems according to the following yaml format example (the feedback section can be left blank for now):
