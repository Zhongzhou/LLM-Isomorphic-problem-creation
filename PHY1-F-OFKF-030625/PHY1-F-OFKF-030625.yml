        - prompt 1: |-
            I'm writing physics problems involving calculation of kinetic friction and balance of forces on a moving object. As a first step, please help me by doing the following:
            Generate 10 different cases of an object being pulled or pushed by either a human, an animal, or a machine/vehicle across a surface. Indicate whether the pushing or pulling force must be angled upwards or downwards. 
            Here are some examples: 
            horse pulling a sledge on snow. upwards.
            A person pushing a couch across carpeted floor. Downwards.  
            a person dragging a heavy luggage case. Upwards.
            A towing truck dragging a damaged car on rough road. Upwards
        - prompt 2: | # Should add instruction to download the outcome into csv in the future. That is for quality checking.
            Now for each of those 10 cases, first generate the following set of values
            1. Coefficient of kinetic friction, \mu_k. Between 0.1 and 0.9
            2. Angle of the force \theta. Positive 10 degrees to 60 degrees if the force is upwards, negative 10 degrees to 60 degrees if the force is downwards.
            3. Mass of the object being pulled or pushed, M. Appropriate for the object being pushed or pulled, in units of kg.
            4. In addition, generate a generous estimation of the force that can be exerted by the human, animal or machine doing the pushing or pulling (not the object).
            Next, calculate the magnitude of the force according to:

              F = \mu * m *g/(cos(\theta) + \mu*sin(\theta)).
    
            Check if the magnitude of F (in Newtons) is within the estimated range, and if the magnitude is positive. If yes, list the values. If not, re-generate the random numbers.
        - prompt 3: |
            For each of the 10 scenarios and the corresponding set of numbers, write a physics problem following those steps:

            1. Choose either F, m, or \mu_k as the unknown variable.
            2. Describe the situation and explain the known variables.
            3. Imply that the object is moving/sliding at constant or uniform speed.
            4. When stating the angle, explicitly state if it is upward or downward with respect to the horizontal, but not write any negative signs.
            5. If the object is pulled by a rope or a chain or similar objects, state the angle as the rope/chain forms an angle of ….. with respect to the horizon
            6. Ask students to calculate the unknown variable, and specify the unit. For example, find the force F in units of Newtons.
            7. Specify significant figures required for the answer.
        - prompt 4: |
            Write concise student facing solutions for the first 5 problems. Each solution should include the following elements:

            1. Explain that due to the object moving at constant velocity along a flat surface, the acceleration is zero in both directions, so the total force on both horizontal and vertical directions must both add up to zero according to Newton's second law of motion.

            2. set positive x in the direction of the object's motion and positive y pointing up in the vertical direction.

            3. Write down the sum of forces along the y-axis equal to zero expression, starting with \sum(\vec{F_y}) = ... = 0

            4. Similarly, write down the sum of forces along the x axis equal to zero expression, using f to represent friction.

            5. Find the friction force using the kinetic friction force equation, and find the normal force using the y-axis forces equation.

            6. Find the unknown variable.

            7. If the force is pointing downward, add a sentence clarifying that since the force is pointing below the x-axis, the numerical value of the variable \theta should be negative the value used in the problem.

            Do not use numbers, instead, use languages similar to "First, notice that.... Next, we can define..., We can then write down...".

    title: Worker Pushing a Wooden Crate
    points: 3
    text: | 
      A worker is pushing a wooden crate across a concrete floor at a uniform speed. 
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is $0.36$. 
      The worker applies a force at an angle of $12.74^\circ$ downward with respect to the horizontal. 
      The required force exerted is $465.64$ N. The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81$ m/s².  

      Find the mass of the crate in kilograms. Express your answer with two significant figures.

    answer:
        value: 117.67

        general: | 
          First, notice that since the crate is moving at a constant velocity across a flat surface, its acceleration is zero in both the horizontal and vertical directions. According to Newton’s second law, the sum of forces in both directions must be zero.

          Next, we can define the positive $x$-direction as the direction of motion and the positive $y$-direction as pointing upward.

          We can then write down the force balance in the vertical direction:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_y} = N - mg - F \sin(\theta) = 0
          \]
          where $N$ is the normal force, $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $F$ is the applied force at an angle $\theta$.

          Similarly, for the horizontal direction:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]
          where $f$ is the kinetic friction force.

          The friction force is given by:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N
          \]
          Substituting the expression for $N$ from the vertical force equation:  
          \[
          N = mg + F \sin(\theta)
          \]
          we get:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Now, substituting $f$ into the horizontal force equation:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $m$:  
          \[
          m = \frac{F \cos(\theta)}{\mu_k g + \mu_k F \sin(\theta)}
          \]
          Since the force is pointing downward, we note that $\theta$ should be considered negative in calculations.

    title: Dog Pulling a Small Sled

      A dog is pulling a small sled across an icy path at a steady speed. 
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the sled and the ice is $0.59$. 
      The sled has a mass of $10.21$ kg. 
      The dog pulls the sled using a rope, which forms an angle of $31.21^\circ$ with respect to the horizon. 
      The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81$ m/s².  

      Determine the force exerted by the dog in Newtons. Give your answer with two significant figures.

    answer:
        value: 50.94
        tolerance: 0.05
    feedback:
        general: |
          Since the sled is moving at a constant velocity, its acceleration is zero. By Newton’s second law, the sum of forces in both directions must add up to zero.

          We define the positive $x$-direction as the direction of motion and the positive $y$-direction as pointing upward.

          For the vertical forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_y} = N - mg + F \sin(\theta) = 0
          \]

          For the horizontal forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]

          The friction force is:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N
          \]
          Substituting $N$:  
          \[
          N = mg - F \sin(\theta)
          \]
          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg - F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Substituting this into the horizontal force balance:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg - F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $F$:  
          \[
          F = \frac{\mu_k mg}{\cos(\theta) + \mu_k \sin(\theta)}
          \]

      A traveler is dragging a rolling backpack across an asphalt road at a constant speed. 
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the backpack and the ground is $0.73$. 
      The person pulls the backpack at an angle of $37.92^\circ$ upward with respect to the horizontal. 
      The force applied by the traveler is $59.81$ N. 
      The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81$ m/s².  

      Calculate the mass of the backpack in kilograms. Express your answer with two significant figures.

    answer:
        value: 10.36
        tolerance: 0.05

        general: |
          Since the backpack is moving at a constant velocity, Newton’s second law tells us that the forces must sum to zero in both directions.

          We define positive $x$ as the direction of motion and positive $y$ as the upward vertical direction.

          For vertical forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_y} = N - mg + F \sin(\theta) = 0
          \]

          For horizontal forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]

          The friction force is:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N

          Substituting $N$:

          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg - F \sin(\theta))

          Using the horizontal equation:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg - F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $m$:  
          \[
          m = \frac{F \cos(\theta)}{\mu_k g + \mu_k F \sin(\theta)}

      A child is pushing a toy truck across a sandy playground at a uniform speed. 
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the toy truck and the sand is $0.40$. 
      The child applies a force of $41.93$ N at an angle of $32.04^\circ$ downward with respect to the horizontal. 
      The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81$ m/s².  

      Determine the mass of the toy truck in kilograms. Round your answer to two significant figures.

        general: |
          Since the toy truck moves at a constant velocity, its acceleration is zero, meaning forces must sum to zero in both directions.

          We set the positive $x$-direction along the motion and positive $y$-direction upward.

          For vertical forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_y} = N - mg - F \sin(\theta) = 0

          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]

          The friction force is:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N
          \]
          Substituting $N$:  
          \[

          \]
          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Using the horizontal equation:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $m$:  
          \[
          m = \frac{F \cos(\theta)}{\mu_k g + \mu_k F \sin(\theta)}
          \]
          Since the force is downward, the angle $\theta$ should be considered negative in calculations.

          For the horizontal forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]

          The friction force is:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N
          \]
          Substituting $N$:  
          \[
          N = mg - F \sin(\theta)
          \]
          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg - F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Using the horizontal equation:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg - F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $F$:  
          \[
          F = \frac{\mu_k mg}{\cos(\theta) + \mu_k \sin(\theta)}
          \]
          Since the force is applied upward through a towing cable, the angle $\theta$ remains positive.

    title: Construction Worker Pushing a Wheelbarrow
    points: 3
    text: | 
      A construction worker is pushing a loaded wheelbarrow up a ramp at a uniform speed. 
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the wheelbarrow and the ramp surface is $0.38$. 
      The worker applies a force at an angle of $18.62^\circ$ downward with respect to the horizontal. 
      The required force exerted is $274.39$ N. 
      The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81$ m/s².  

      Determine the mass of the wheelbarrow in kilograms. Express your answer with two significant figures.

    answer:
        value: 87.64
        tolerance: 0.05

        general: |
          Since the wheelbarrow moves at a uniform speed, the total forces in both directions must add up to zero.

          We set positive $x$ as the direction of motion and positive $y$ as upward.

          For vertical forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_y} = N - mg - F \sin(\theta) = 0
          \]

          For horizontal forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]

          The friction force is:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N
          \]
          Substituting $N$:  
          \[
          N = mg + F \sin(\theta)
          \]
          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Using the horizontal equation:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $m$:  
          \[
          m = \frac{F \cos(\theta)}{\mu_k g + \mu_k F \sin(\theta)}
          \]
          Since the force is downward, the numerical value of $\theta$ should be negative in calculations.

    title: Bulldozer Pushing a Pile of Dirt
    points: 3
    text: | 
      A bulldozer is pushing a pile of dirt across rocky ground at a constant speed. 
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the dirt and the ground is $0.72$. 
      The bulldozer applies a force at an angle of $48.15^\circ$ downward with respect to the horizontal. 
      The pile of dirt has a mass of $2743.68$ kg. 
      The acceleration due to gravity is $9.81$ m/s².  

      Find the force exerted by the bulldozer in Newtons. Round your answer to two significant figures.

    answer:
        value: 20832.57
        tolerance: 0.05
    feedback:
        general: |
          Since the pile of dirt moves at a constant velocity, Newton’s second law states that the forces must sum to zero in both directions.

          We define positive $x$ along the direction of motion and positive $y$ upward.

          For the vertical forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_y} = N - mg - F \sin(\theta) = 0
          \]

          For the horizontal forces:  
          \[
          \sum \vec{F_x} = F \cos(\theta) - f = 0
          \]

          The friction force is:  
          \[
          f = \mu_k N
          \]
          Substituting $N$:  
          \[
          N = mg + F \sin(\theta)
          \]
          \[
          f = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Using the horizontal equation:  
          \[
          F \cos(\theta) = \mu_k (mg + F \sin(\theta))
          \]
          Solving for $F$:  
          \[
          F = \frac{\mu_k mg}{\cos(\theta) + \mu_k \sin(\theta)}
          \]
          Since the force is downward, the numerical value of $\theta$ should be negative in calculations.
