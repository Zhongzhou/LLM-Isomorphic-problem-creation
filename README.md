# Example isomorphic problem bank generated by chatGPT via prompt-chaining and tool use

[PHY1-F-OFKF-030625](PHY1-F-OFKF-030625): Problem bank of a force pushing an object at an angle on rough surfaces. (bank 1)

[PHY1-2D-TRAJCOMP-041152](PHY1-2D-TRAJCOMP-041152): Problem bank for conceptual problems comparing three different trajectories. (bank 2)

## Folder Contents

1. YAML file (.yml): This file has two parts. 
    * The metadata part contains the **prompt-chain** used for problem bank generation, and additional information about the problem bank.
    * The questions part contains the generated problems and solutions stored in a YAML format.
    * It is recommended to view the YAML files in either VS Code or Notebook ++ for proper text highlighting.

2. PDF document: This is a saved version of the conversation between the creator and chatGPT during the generation of the problems.

3. Python scripts: Those are the python scripts generation by chatGPT via tool-use

4. Figure folder: Contains all the problem diagrams

5. Single/Simple prompt test folder: Contains the conversation history and outcome of the single prompt/simple prompt tests. Note that a yaml file is not generated for those tests because they were unsuccessful.
